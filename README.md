Your list covers various aspects of testing the login screen thoroughly. Here's a breakdown of each test case:

Test with correct email/password combination: Ensure that users can successfully log in with a valid email and password combination.

Test with incorrect email/password combination: Verify that users cannot log in with an incorrect email and password combination and receive an appropriate error message.

Test with unregistered email: Confirm that attempting to log in with an email that is not registered in the system results in an appropriate error message.

Test with correct email and password with wrong case: Check if the login functionality is case-sensitive by attempting to log in with correct credentials but with the wrong case (e.g., "sooriya@gmail.com" instead of "Sooiya11.com").

Test with very long password: Verify that users can log in successfully with a password that meets the maximum length requirement, ensuring that the system can handle long passwords securely.

Test with blank password: Ensure that users cannot log in with a blank password field and receive an appropriate error message prompting them to enter a password.
